      title: "1. Introduction",
      content: `
The Binary Number System is the foundation of all modern digital computers.

Unlike the decimal system which uses ten digits (0-9), binary uses only two digits:

0 and 1.

These digits are called bits.

    },

    {
      title: "2. Why Computers Use Binary",
      content: `
Electronic circuits naturally have two stable states:

ON and OFF

HIGH and LOW

TRUE and FALSE

These states are represented using 1 and 0.
`
    },

    {
      title: "3. Decimal Review",
      content: `
The decimal system is base 10.

Example:

527

=

5×10² + 2×10¹ + 7×10⁰

Each position represents a power of 10.
`
    },

    {
      title: "4. Binary Place Values",
      content: `
Binary is base 2.

Example:

1011₂

=

1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰
`
    },

    {
      title: "5. Binary to Decimal Conversion",
      content: `
Example:

101101₂

=

1×32 + 0×16 + 1×8 + 1×4 + 0×2 + 1×1

=

45₁₀
`
    },

    {
      title: "6. Decimal to Binary Conversion",
      content: `
Repeatedly divide by 2.

Record remainders.

Read remainders from bottom to top.

Example:

13₁₀ = 1101₂
`
    },

    {
      title: "7. Binary Digits",
      content: `
A binary digit is called a bit.

Examples:

0 bit

1 bit

Computers store information using billions of bits.
`
    },

    {
      title: "8. Byte Representation",
      content: `
8 bits = 1 byte

Examples:

00000000

11111111

A byte can represent values from 0 to 255.

Rules:

0+0=0

0+1=1

1+0=1

1+1=10

Carry occurs when sum exceeds 1.
`
    },

    {
      title: "11. Binary Subtraction",
      content: `
Rules:

1−0=1

1−1=0

Borrowing may be required just like decimal subtraction.

    {
      title: "12. Binary Multiplication",
      content: `
Rules:

0×0=0

0×1=0

1×0=0

1×1=1

The process resembles decimal multiplication.
