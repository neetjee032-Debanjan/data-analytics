      title: "1. Introduction",
      content: `
Numerical differentiation is used when the derivative of a function cannot be obtained analytically.

In engineering and scientific computing, data is often available only at discrete points.

Forward Difference is the simplest numerical method for approximating derivatives.

It estimates the slope using information ahead of the current point.

This method forms the foundation of numerical differentiation.

    {
      title: "2. Why Numerical Differentiation?",
      content: `
Many real-world systems produce measured data instead of explicit equations.

Examples:

• Experimental measurements
• Sensor readings
• Weather data
• Financial data

When only discrete values are available, derivatives must be approximated numerically.

    {
      title: "3. Review of Derivatives",
      content: `
The derivative of a function represents its rate of change.

Mathematically:

f'(x) = lim(h→0)
[f(x+h)-f(x)]/h

This definition is the starting point for all finite difference methods.
`
    },

    {
      title: "4. Forward Difference Formula",
      content: `
Replacing the limit with a small finite step h gives:

f'(x) ≈
[f(x+h)-f(x)] / h

This is known as the Forward Difference Formula.

It uses the current point and the next point.

    },

    {
      title: "5. Geometric Interpretation",
      content: `
Imagine two nearby points on a curve.

A straight line joins them.

The slope of this line approximates the derivative.

As h becomes smaller, the approximation becomes more accurate.

      title: "7. Worked Example I",
      content: `
Find the derivative of:

f(x)=x²

at x=2

Choose:

h=0.1

f(2)=4

f(2.1)=4.41

Derivative:

(4.41-4)/0.1

=4.1

Exact derivative:

2x=4

Approximation is close.

    {
      title: "8. Worked Example II",
      content: `
f(x)=sin(x)

x=0

h=0.01

Derivative:

[sin(0.01)-sin(0)]/0.01

≈0.99998

Exact derivative:

cos(0)=1

    {
      title: "9. Error Analysis",
      content: `
Forward Difference contains truncation error.

The error is proportional to h.

Reducing h generally improves accuracy.

However extremely small h can introduce floating-point errors.
`
    },

    {
      title: "10. Order of Accuracy",
      content: `
Forward Difference is a first-order method.

Error:

O(h)

If h is reduced by a factor of 10, the error approximately decreases by a factor of 10.
