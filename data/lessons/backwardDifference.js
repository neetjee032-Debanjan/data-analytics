      title: "1. Introduction",
      content: `
Backward Difference is another finite difference method used to approximate derivatives.

Unlike Forward Difference, which uses a future point, Backward Difference uses information from a previous point.

It is especially useful when future data is unavailable.

Many engineering systems use Backward Difference for real-time calculations.

    {
      title: "2. Motivation",
      content: `
Suppose measurements are collected sequentially.

At a given instant, future values may not yet be known.

In such situations Forward Difference cannot be applied.

Backward Difference solves this problem by using already available data.

    {
      title: "3. Derivative Definition",
      content: `
Recall the derivative definition:

f'(x)=lim(h→0)
[f(x+h)-f(x)]/h

By rewriting the expression using previous points, we obtain the Backward Difference approximation.
`
    },

    {
      title: "4. Backward Difference Formula",
      content: `
The formula is:

f'(x) ≈
[f(x)-f(x-h)]/h

This approximation uses the current point and the previous point.

It is one of the simplest numerical differentiation formulas.

    {
      title: "5. Geometric Interpretation",
      content: `
Imagine two nearby points on a curve.

One point is located behind the current position.

The slope of the secant line joining them approximates the derivative.

As h decreases, the approximation becomes increasingly accurate.

      title: "7. Worked Example I",
      content: `
Find the derivative of:

f(x)=x²

at x=2

Choose:

h=0.1

f(2)=4

f(1.9)=3.61

Derivative:

(4-3.61)/0.1

=3.9

Exact derivative:

4

Approximation is close.

      title: "8. Worked Example II",
      content: `
Find the derivative of:

f(x)=e^x

at x=1

Using:

h=0.01

Backward Difference provides an approximation very close to the exact derivative e.

    {
      title: "9. Truncation Error",
      content: `
Backward Difference contains truncation error.

The error depends on the step size h.

Reducing h generally improves accuracy.

However numerical round-off errors eventually become important.
`
    },

    {
      title: "10. Order of Accuracy",
      content: `
Backward Difference is a first-order method.

Error:

O(h)

Its theoretical accuracy is identical to Forward Difference.
