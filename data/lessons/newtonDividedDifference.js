      title: "1. Introduction",
      content: `
Newton Divided Difference Interpolation is a powerful interpolation technique that works even when data points are not equally spaced.

Unlike Newton Forward and Newton Backward methods, equal spacing is not required.

This makes the method highly flexible for real-world datasets.
`
    },

    {
      title: "2. Motivation",
      content: `
Many experimental datasets are irregularly spaced.

Forward and Backward interpolation cannot be applied directly.

Newton Divided Difference solves this problem efficiently.
`
    },

    {
      title: "3. Interpolation Goal",
      content: `
Given a set of points:

(x₀,y₀)

(x₁,y₁)

(x₂,y₂)

...

construct a polynomial that passes through all points.
`
    },

    {
      title: "4. First Divided Difference",
      content: `
The first divided difference is:

f[x₀,x₁]

=

(y₁-y₀)/(x₁-x₀)

It represents the slope between two points.
`
    },

    {
      title: "5. Second Divided Difference",
      content: `
The second divided difference is:

f[x₀,x₁,x₂]

=

(f[x₁,x₂]-f[x₀,x₁])

/

(x₂-x₀)

This captures curvature information.
`
    },

    {
      title: "6. Higher Order Differences",
      content: `
The process continues recursively.

Third, fourth and higher-order differences can be constructed similarly.

These values become coefficients of the interpolation polynomial.
`
    },

    {
      title: "7. Newton Polynomial",
      content: `
The interpolation polynomial is:

P(x)=

f[x₀]

+

f[x₀,x₁](x-x₀)

+

f[x₀,x₁,x₂](x-x₀)(x-x₁)

+ ...
`
    },

    {
      title: "8. Recursive Structure",
      content: `
One major advantage is that new points can be added without rebuilding the entire polynomial.

Only new divided differences need to be computed.
`
    },

    {
      title: "9. Example",
      content: `
Points:

(1,1)

(2,4)

(3,9)

Construct divided differences.

Build the interpolation polynomial.

Verify that all points are satisfied.

    },

    {
      title: "10. Difference Table",
      content: `
A divided difference table organizes all computed coefficients.

The top entries of each column become polynomial coefficients.

    },

Step 2:
Extract coefficients.

Step 3:
Construct Newton polynomial.

Step 4:
