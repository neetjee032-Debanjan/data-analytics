      title: "1. Introduction",
      content: `
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the most important algorithms ever developed.

It computes the same result as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) but much faster.

Without FFT, many modern technologies would be impractical.

Applications include:

• Audio processing
• Video compression
• Medical imaging
• Wireless communication
• Artificial intelligence
• Scientific computing

FFT transformed digital signal processing forever.

    {
      title: "2. The Problem with DFT",
      content: `
The DFT requires:

O(N²)

operations.

For N samples:

Every output frequency requires examining every input sample.

As N grows, computational cost increases dramatically.

Example:

N = 1,000,000

Direct DFT becomes extremely expensive.

A faster approach was needed.

    },

    {
      title: "3. FFT's Main Idea",
      content: `
FFT does not change the mathematics.

Instead, it reorganizes computations intelligently.

It exploits:

• Symmetry
• Periodicity
• Repeated calculations

to eliminate unnecessary work.

Result:

Exactly the same output as DFT.

Much lower computation time.
`
    },

    {
      title: "4. Complexity Improvement",
      content: `
DFT Complexity:

O(N²)

FFT Complexity:

O(N log₂N)

This improvement is enormous.

For N = 1,000,000:

DFT ≈ 10¹² operations

FFT ≈ 20,000,000 operations

The speedup can exceed tens of thousands of times.

    {
      title: "5. Historical Background",
      content: `
Although similar ideas existed earlier,

James Cooley and John Tukey popularized FFT in 1965.

Their work revolutionized:

• Engineering
• Physics
• Communications
• Computer Science

FFT is frequently listed among the most important algorithms of the 20th century.

    },

    {
      title: "6. Divide and Conquer Strategy",
      content: `
FFT uses Divide and Conquer.

Instead of solving one large DFT:

Solve many smaller DFTs.

Then combine the results efficiently.

Large Problem

↓

Smaller Problems

↓

Even Smaller Problems

↓

Combine Results

This dramatically reduces computation.
`
    },

    {
      title: "7. Even and Odd Decomposition",
      content: `
A sequence can be separated into:

Even-index samples

and

Odd-index samples

Example:

x[0], x[2], x[4], ...

x[1], x[3], x[5], ...

FFT computes transforms of these smaller sequences separately.
`
    },

    {
      title: "8. Recursive Structure",
      content: `
FFT repeatedly splits data.

N

↓

N/2

↓

N/4

↓

N/8

↓

...

until very small DFTs remain.

This recursive structure is one reason FFT is so efficient.

    },

    {
      title: "9. Radix-2 FFT",
      content: `
The most common FFT is:

Radix-2 FFT

Requirement:

N = 2^m

Examples:

8

16

32

64

128

1024

etc.

Radix-2 FFT is widely used because of its simplicity and efficiency.

    {
      title: "10. Butterfly Operation",
      content: `
The fundamental FFT computation is called a Butterfly.

A butterfly combines:

Two inputs

↓

Two outputs

using a few arithmetic operations.

Large FFTs are built from thousands of butterfly operations.

    {
      title: "11. Twiddle Factors",
      content: `
FFT uses special complex constants called:

Twiddle Factors

Defined as:

Wₙ = e^(-j2π/N)

Twiddle factors capture rotational symmetry in complex space.

They allow efficient combination of smaller transforms.
`
    },

    {
      title: "12. Bit-Reversal Ordering",
      content: `
Many FFT implementations reorder data using:

Bit-Reversal

Example:

000 → 000

001 → 100

010 → 010

011 → 110

This arrangement helps FFT computations proceed efficiently.

• Phase Spectrum
• Frequency Components

No approximation is introduced.

FFT is simply a faster computational method.
